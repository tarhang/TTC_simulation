# TTC_simulation
This is a simulation of the Bloor-Danforth TTC line using custom-defined linked list data structures. Passengers, trains, and stations are  simulated using structures, `struct`, in C. Each `.c` file contains the implementation of the methods of one of these structures. The function headers and `struct` definitions can be found in the header file, `ttc.h`. 

This project was implemented as a CSC190 course project at the University of Toronto in winter 2013. You can learn more about the project [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab3.html) and [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab4.html).
