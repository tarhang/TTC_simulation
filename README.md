# TTC_simulation
This is a simulation of the Bloor-Danforth [TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/) line using custom-defined linked list data structures in C. The simulation is done by implementing passengers, trains, and stations as structs. 

This project was implemented as a CSC190 course project at the University of Toronto in winter 2013. You can learn more about the project goals and requirements [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab3.html) and [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab4.html). 

## Installation
Navigate to the directory you want to clone the project to. Clone the repo using the following git bash command
```
git clone https://github.com/tarhang/TTC_simulation.git
```

## Usage
* `ttc.h` - contains data structure definitions and function headers.
* `passengers.c` - contains the implementation of methods related to the passenger data structure (passengers are implemented using linked lists)
* `trains.c` - 
* `stations.c` -
