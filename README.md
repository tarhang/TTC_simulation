# TTC_simulation
This is a simulation of the Bloor-Danforth [TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/) line using custom-defined linked list data structures in C. The simulation is done by implementing passengers, trains, and stations as structs. The implementation of the corresponding methods can be found in `passengers.c`, `trains.c`, and `stations.c`. The function headers and structure definitions can be found in the header file, `ttc.h`. 

This project was implemented as a CSC190 course project at the University of Toronto in winter 2013. You can learn more about the project goals and requirements [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab3.html) and [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab4.html).
