# TTC_simulation
This is a simulation of the Bloor-Danforth TTC line using custom-defined linked list data structures. The objects simulated are 'passengers', 'trains', and 'stations' all implemented as `struct`.

This project was implemented as a CSC190 course project at the University of Toronto in winter 2013. You can learn more about the project [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab3.html) and [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab4.html).
