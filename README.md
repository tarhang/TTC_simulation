# TTC_simulation
This is a simulation of the Bloor-Danforth [TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/) line using custom-defined linked list data structures in C. In this project, passengers, trains, and stations are simulated using structures. Each `passengers.c`, `trains.c`, and `stations.c` contain the implementation of the methods of passengers, trains, and stations, respectively. The function headers and structure definitions can be found in the header file, `ttc.h`. 

This project was implemented as a CSC190 course project at the University of Toronto in winter 2013. You can learn more about the project [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab3.html) and [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~patitsas/cs190/lab4.html).
